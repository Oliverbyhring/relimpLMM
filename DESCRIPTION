Description: This package can be used to calculate the relative variable importance of the variables in a random intercept model with one random 
  effect that is created using the lmer function in the lme4 package. The method used is an extension of the method suggested by Lindeman, Marenda and Gold(1980),
  it is reviewed by Groemping(2007) in the article "Estimators of Relative Importance in Linear Regression Based on Variance Decomposition". The extension is
  described by Byhring(2019) "Estimators of relative importance in linear regression based on variance decomposition".
